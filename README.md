Concurrent Cache Trie Data Structure
------------------------------------
There are two versions of the data structure: a concurrent cache trie and a STM cache trie.

To test the cache trie data structure follow the instructions below:
Note: Requires *cmake*, *make*, and *gcc* to be installed.

----------
##### Concurrent Cache Trie
1. Go to the `ConcurrentCacheTrie` folder
1. Create a folder called `build`
2. Go into the `build` folder
3. In the terminal, run `cmake ..`
4. Run `make`
5. Execute the test program in the terminal with  `./Concurrent-cache-trie`

##### STM Cache Trie
1. Go to the `GCC_TM_CacheTrie` folder
1. Create a folder called `build`
2. Go into the `build` folder
3. In the terminal, run `cmake ..`
4. Run `make`
5. Execute the test program in the terminal with  `./Concurrent-cache-trie`

----------

Note: For Windows using GitBash, cmake command is "cmake.exe -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_SH="CMAKE_SH-NOTFOUND" .."
